# open-LoB
An open-source implementation of Library of Babel (see libraryofbabel.info for more... info) using Python. Book pages are generated by utilising the Hammersley Set (HS) to create subrandom numbers that are then encoded in base 29 (or whatever base you'd like, really). Using HS yields unique and reversible sets of binary bits of arbitrary length, so the library is expandable to any base or length of pages you fancy.
